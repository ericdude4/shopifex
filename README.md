[![Hex.pm](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/shopifex.svg)](https://hex.pm/packages/shopifex)

A simple boilerplate package for creating Shopify embedded apps with the Elixir Phoenix framework. [https://hexdocs.pm/shopifex](https://hexdocs.pm/shopifex)

## Installation

The package can be installed
by adding `shopifex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`: (note, OTP 22 or greater required)

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:shopifex, "~> 2.1"}
  ]
end
```
## Quickstart
#### Run the install script
This will install all of the supported Shopifex features.
```
mix shopifex.install
```
Follow the output `config.ex` and `router.ex` instructions from the install script.
#### Run migrations
```
mix ecto.migrate
```
#### Update Shopify app details
Replace tunnel-url with your own where applicable.
- Set "App URL" to `https://my-app.ngrok.io/auth`
- Add `https://my-app.ngrok.io/auth/install` & `https://my-app.ngrok.io/auth/update` to your app's "Allowed redirection URL(s)"
- Add your Shopify app's API key and API secret key to `config :shopifex, api_key: "your-api-key", secret: "your-api-secret"`

## Manual Installation
Create the shop schema where the installation data will be stored:
```
mix phx.gen.schema Shop shops url:string access_token:string scope:string
mix ecto.migrate
```

Add the `:shopifex` config settings to your `config.ex`. More config details [here](https://hexdocs.pm/shopifex)

```elixir
config :shopifex,
  app_name: "MyApp",
  shop_schema: MyApp.Shop,
  web_module: MyAppWeb,
  repo: MyApp.Repo,
  redirect_uri: "https://myapp.ngrok.io/auth/install",
  reinstall_uri: "https://myapp.ngrok.io/auth/update",
  webhook_uri: "https://myapp.ngrok.io/webhook",
  scopes: "read_inventory,write_inventory,read_products,write_products,read_orders",
  api_key: "shopifyapikey123",
  secret: "shopifyapisecret456",
  webhook_topics: ["app/uninstalled"], # These are automatically subscribed on a store upon install
  allowed_drift: 10_000 # session token exp/nbf tolerance in ms (defaults to 10s)
```

Update your `endpoint.ex` to include the custom body parser. This is necessary for HMAC validation to work.

```elixir
plug Plug.Parsers,
  parsers: [:urlencoded, :multipart, :json],
  pass: ["*/*"],
  body_reader: {ShopifexWeb.CacheBodyReader, :read_body, []},
  json_decoder: Phoenix.json_library()
```

Add this line near the top of `router.ex` to include the Shopifex pipelines

```elixir
require ShopifexWeb.Routes
ShopifexWeb.Routes.pipelines()
```
Now the following pipelines are accessible:

- `:shopify_session` -> Validates request (HMAC header/param or token param) and makes session information available via `Shopifex.Plug` API. Also removes iFrame blocking headers so app can render in Shopify admin.
- `:shopify_webhook` -> Validates Shopify webhook requests HMAC and makes session information available via `Shopifex.Plug` API.
- `:shopify_admin_link` -> Validates Shopify admin link & bulk action link requests and makes session information available via `Shopifex.Plug` API.
- `:shopify_api` -> Ensures that a valid Shopify session token or Shopifex token are present in `Authorization` header. Useful for async requests between your SPA front end and Shopifex backend.
- `:shopifex_browser` -> Same as your normal `:browser` pipeline, except it calls `Shopifex.Plug.LoadInIframe`.  Deprecated; does not work with Phoenix 1.6 generated apps.

Now add this basic example of these plugs in action in `router.ex`. These endpoints need to be added to your Shopify app whitelist

### Routing
```elixir
# Include all auth (when Shopify requests to render your app in an iframe), installation and update routes 
ShopifexWeb.Routes.auth_routes(MyAppWeb.AuthController)

# Add the LoadInIframe plug to your existing :browser pipeline
pipeline :browser do
  # ... Other plugs
  plug Shopifex.Plug.LoadInIframe
end

# Endpoints accessible within the Shopify admin panel iFrame.
# Don't include this scope block if you are creating a SPA.
scope "/", MyAppWeb do
  pipe_through [:browser, :shopify_session]

  get "/", PageController, :index
end

# Make your webhook endpoint look like this
scope "/webhook", MyAppWeb do
  pipe_through [:shopify_webhook]

  post "/", WebhookController, :action
end

# Place your admin link endpoints in here
scope "/admin-links", MyAppWeb do
  pipe_through [:shopify_admin_link]

  get "/do-a-thing", AdminLinkController, :do_a_thing
end
```

Create a new controller called `auth_controller.ex` to handle the initial iFrame load and installation

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.AuthController do
  use MyAppWeb, :controller
  use ShopifexWeb.AuthController

  # Thats it! Validation, installation are now handled for you :)
  
  # Optionally, override the `after_install` callback
  def after_install(conn, shop) do
    # TODO: send yourself an e-mail
    # follow default behaviour.
    super(conn, shop)
  end
end
```
Setting up your application as a SPA? Read this before continuing [Single Page Applications](#single-page-applications)

create another controller called `webhook_controller.ex` to handle incoming Shopify webhooks (optional)

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.WebhookController do
  use MyAppWeb, :controller
  use ShopifexWeb.WebhookController

  # add as many handle_topic/3 functions here as you like! This basic one handles app uninstallation
  def handle_topic(conn, shop, "app/uninstalled") do
    Shopifex.Shops.delete_shop(shop)

    conn
    |> send_resp(200, "success")
  end

  # Mandatory Shopify shop data erasure GDPR webhook. Simply delete the shop record
  def handle_topic(conn, shop, "shop/redact") do
    Shopifex.Shops.delete_shop(shop)

    conn
    |> send_resp(204, "")
  end

  # Mandatory Shopify customer data erasure GDPR webhook. Simply delete the shop (customer) record
  def handle_topic(conn, shop, "customers/redact") do
    Shopifex.Shops.delete_shop(shop)

    conn
    |> send_resp(204, "")
  end

  # Mandatory Shopify customer data request GDPR webhook.
  def handle_topic(conn, _shop, "customers/data_request") do
    # Send an email of the shop data to the customer.
    conn
    |> send_resp(202, "Accepted")
  end
end
```
## Maintaining session between page loads for server-rendered applications
As browsers continue to restrict cookies, cookies become more unreliable as a method for maintaining a session within an iFrame. To address this, Shopify recommends passing a JWT session token back and forth between requests.

Shopifex makes a token accessible with `Shopifex.Plug.session_token(conn)` in any request which passes through a `:shopify_*` router pipeline.

Ensure there is a `token` parameter sent along in any requests which you would like to maintain session between.

EEx template link:
```elixir
<%= link "home", to: Routes.page_path(@conn, :index, %{token: Shopifex.Plug.session_token(conn)}) %>
```
EEx template form:
```elixir
<%= form_for :foo, Routes.foo_path(MyApp.Endpoint, :new, %{token: Shopifex.Plug.session_token(@conn)}), fn f -> %>
  <%= submit "Submit" %>
<% end %>
```

## Update app permissions

You can also update the app permissions after installation. To do so, first you have to add `your-redirect-url.com/auth/update` to Shopify's whitelist.

To add e.g. the `read_customers` scope, you can do so by redirecting them to the following example url:

```
https://{shop-name}.myshopify.com/admin/oauth/request_grant?client_id=API_KEY&redirect_uri={YOUR_REINSTALL_URL}/auth/update&scope={YOUR_SCOPES},read_customers
```

## Add payment guards to routes
This system allows you to use the `Shopifex.Plug.PaymentGuard` plug. If the merchant does not have an active grant associated with the named guard, it will redirect them to a plan selection page, allow them to pay, and handle the payment callback all automatically. I am working on the admin panel where you can register Plan objects which grant `premium_plan` (for example) - but for now these need to be entered manually into the database.

Generate the schemas

`mix phx.gen.schema Shops.Plan plans name:string price:string features:array:string grants:array:string test:boolean usages:integer type:string`

`mix phx.gen.schema Shops.Grant grants shop_id:references:shops charge_id:integer grants:array:string remaining_usages:integer total_usages:integer`

Add the config options:
```elixir
config :my_app,
  payment_guard: MyApp.Shops.PaymentGuard,
  grant_schema: MyApp.Shops.Grant,
  plan_schema: MyApp.Shops.Plan,
  payment_redirect_uri: "https://myapp.ngrok.io/payment/complete"
```
Serve the Shopifex assets for the plans selection page. Add the following to `endpoint.ex`:
```elixir
# Serve at "/shopifex-assets" the static files from shopifex.
plug Plug.Static,
  at: "/shopifex-assets",
  from: :shopifex,
  gzip: false,
  only: ~w(css fonts images js favicon.ico robots.txt)
```
Create the payment guard module:
```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Shops.PaymentGuard do
  use Shopifex.PaymentGuard
end
```
Create a new payment controller:
```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.PaymentController do
  use MyAppWeb, :controller
  use ShopifexWeb.PaymentController
end
```
Add payment routes to `router.ex`:
```elixir
ShopifexWeb.Routes.payment_routes(MyAppWeb.PaymentController)
```

To manage plans, I recommend using [kaffy admin package](https://github.com/aesmail/kaffy)

Now you can protect routes or controller actions with the `Shopifex.Plug.PaymentGuard` plug. Here is an example of it in action on an admin link
```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.AdminLinkController do
  use MyAppWeb, :controller
  require Logger

  plug Shopifex.Plug.PaymentGuard, "premium_plan" when action in [:premium_function]
  
  def premium_function(conn, _params) do
    shop = Shopifex.Plug.current_shop(conn)
    
    # Wow, much premium.
    conn
    |> send_resp(200, "Hi there, #{shop.url}!")
  end
end
```
### Single Page Applications
SPA Shopify applications are also supported with Shopifex for developers who wish to host their front-end application separately from the back-end. This approach takes advantage of [Shopify session tokens](https://shopify.dev/concepts/apps/building-embedded-apps-using-session-tokens).

Adjust your `router.ex` file. You may notice some routes are no longer necessary compared to the quick-start guide.
```elixir
ShopifexWeb.Routes.pipelines()

# These routes will take care of installation/update
ShopifexWeb.Routes.auth_routes(ShopifyAppWeb)

# API routes for your SPA to hit with the axios instance
scope "/api", MyAppWeb do
  pipe_through [:shopify_api]
  
  # An endpoint which your SPA can call on load to get whatever initialization data your app needs.
  # The options macro is required to allow CORS requests on the route.
  options "/initialize", AuthController, :initialize
  get "/initialize", AuthController, :initialize
  
  # Add authenticated routes here as needed.
end
```
And for that `/initialize` endpoint, consider this adjustment to `MyAppWeb.AuthController` and update based on your needs. Perhaps you also want to serialize and return some more information needed by your SPA at startup.
```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.AuthController do
  use MyAppWeb, :controller
  use ShopifexWeb.AuthController
  
  def initialize(conn, _params) do
    shop = Guardian.Plug.current_resource(conn)
    
    render(conn, "initialize.json", %{shop: shop})
  end
end
```
Now, [integrate Shopify session tokens into the Axios instance of your SPA.](https://shopify.dev/tutorials/use-session-tokens-with-axios)
Then from your SPA:
```javascript
import createApp from '@shopify/app-bridge';
// Import your Shopify session_token axios instance based on the Shopify session token axios instructions
import instance from './axios-instance';

const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const shopOrigin = urlParams.get('shop');

window.app = createApp({
  apiKey: "MY_SHOPIFY_API_KEY",
  shopOrigin,
});

// Use your axios instance to call the /api/initialize endpoint
const sessionData = await instance.get('/api/initialize');
// Now you will have access to the current shop and Bob's-yer-uncle!
```
